# Simple and Sinister

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/wkillian/simple-sinister/_apis/build/status/forkmantis.simple-sinister?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/wkillian/simple-sinister/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master)

I am following the [Simple and Sinister](https://smile.amazon.com/Kettlebell-Simple-Sinister-Pavel-Tsatsouline-ebook/dp/B00GF2HP9G) kettlebell program by Pavel Tsatsouline.  I am also a user of todo-txt, and I use it to track the days I practice a Simple routine, complete with sets, reps and weight.

The intention of this project is to leverage the data I'm already collecting to create some sort of visual measure of my progress based on Work Capacity, an idea I was exposed to from youtuber Mark Wildman in his video on [Kettlebelling Nerd Math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcECmuWTL3g).  Work Capacity is simply the sets times the reps times the weight moved for a given movement, which will give you some sort of an idea of the volume of work being done.  I think it will work well within the Simple and Sinister program since the exercises and sets and reps are fixed.

As of this writing, I don't know exactly what it's all going to end up looking like, but it will give me an excuse to play around with a small side project.
